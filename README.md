Many of us don't have a lot of free time, these days. Many of us also have
significant others who happen to LOVE Instagram. A true bae is duty-bound to
like all of his/her partner's pictures, ASAP; however, remembering to do so,
let alone finding the time, can become a real mission.

After many an inquiry of "Why haven't you liked my picture, yet?" paired with
an icy glare, a solution had to be found.\
Enter -> **_InstaBae_**.

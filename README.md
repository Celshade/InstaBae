Many of us have very little free time, these days. Many of us also have
significant others who really LOVE Instagram. A true _bae_ is duty-bound to
like all of his/her partner's pictures; however, remembering to do so,
let alone finding the time, can become a real mission. By default, we already
support our partners and their goals - however big or small. It is only
logical that we show support to their insta-endevours, as well!

After many inquiries of "Why haven't you liked my picture, yet?" paired with
an icy glare beneath furrowed brows, a solution had to be found. Thus, the idea
for **_InstaBae_** was born.

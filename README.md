_Automatically like bae's posts on Instagram._

Many of us have very little free time, these days. Many of us also have
significant others who really LOVE Instagram. A true _bae_ is duty-bound to
like all of their partner's pictures; however, remembering to do so,
let alone finding the time, can become a real mission. By default, we already
support our partners and their goals - however big or small. It is only
logical that we show support to their insta-endevours, as well!

After many an inquiry of "Why haven't you liked my picture, yet?" paired with
an icy glare 'neath furrowed brows, a solution had to be found. Thus, the idea
for **_InstaBae_** was born.

## Requirements
1. _**Python [3.6+]**_: Can be downloaded ->[here](https://www.python.org/)<-
1. _**Selenium**_: Installable from the command line, via **pip**, with `pip install selenium` or downloaded ->[here](https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/)<-
***

## Instructions
Once the requirements are met, simply download the package, navigate to the directory,
and run `./instabae/instabae.py`. Before the magic happens, you will be met with a
short series of prompts where you'll configure your session (run mode, the username
of your target bae, how many posts you wish to 'like', and login credentials).

### Modes (*Not fully implemented! Default will run in Spectator mode)
* **Spectator** - allows you to watch what is happening, on screen.
* **Ninja** - will simply run everything in the shadows (background).

That's it! InstaBae will take care of the rest, whilst you get back to your coffee.
